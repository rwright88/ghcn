# ghcn

Tools for working with Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) data.

## Examples

Find a station based on a matching pattern:

```{r}
library(ghcn)

stations <- find_stations(pattern = "boston")

print(stations[1:6], n = Inf)
```

Read all daily data for one station, given the station ID:

```{r}
dat <- read_dly(id = "USW00014739")

print(dat[1:8])
```

Transform the data into an easier to use format:

```{r}
clean_dly(dat)
```
